<hr>
<p align="center" style="color:white">My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven.<br>
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes.<br>
That boy's not right<br>
Three years ago and I came to know Mary.<br>
First time that someone looked beyond the rumours and the lies.<br>
And saw the man inside<br>
We used to walk down by the river<br>
We used to watch the sun go down<br>
We used to walk along the river and dream our way out of this town<br>
No one understood what I felt for Mary<br>
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone<br>
And Never came home<br>
Man with a badge came knocking next morning<br>
Here was I surrounded by a 1000 fingers suddenly<br>
Pointed right at me<br>
I swear I left her by the river<br>
I swear I left her safe and sound<br>
Oh I need to make it to the river<br>
And leave this old Nebraska town<br>
I think about my life gone by<br>
And how it's done me wrong<br>
There's no escape for me this time<br>
All my rescues have gone<br>
Long Gone<br></p>
